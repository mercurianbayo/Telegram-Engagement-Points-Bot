# Telegram-Engagement-Points-Bot
An AI-driven Telegram agent that manages engagement fairly and automatically rewards user activity. It reduces spammy link exchanges and keeps communities active with personalized interaction.”
Users gain points by engaging with posted links:
Like → +200 pts
Comment → +350 pts
Repost → +500 pts
To post/drop their own link, points are deducted by some cost (configurable).
A user must not be inactive for more than 48 hours — we track last activity and can auto-notify or mark inactive.
Engagement is optional (users are not forced to click all links)
